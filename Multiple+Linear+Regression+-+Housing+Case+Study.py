# # Multiple Linear Regression
# ## Housing Case Study
# 
# #### Problem Statement:
# 
# Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.
# 
# Essentially, the company wants â€”
# 
# 
# - To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
# 
# - To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
# 
# - To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.
# 
# **So interpretation is important!**

# ## Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Data

# In[1]:


# Supress Warnings

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


# In[2]:


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


# In[3]:


housing = pd.read_csv("Housing.csv")


# In[4]:


# Check the head of the dataset
housing.head()


# Inspect the various aspects of the housing dataframe

# In[5]:


housing.shape


# In[6]:


housing.info()


# In[7]:


housing.describe()


# ## Step 2: Visualising the Data
# 
# understanding the data
# - If there is some obvious multicollinearity going on
# - identify if some predictors directly have a strong association with the outcome variable
# 
# We'll visualise our data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

# In[8]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


# #### Visualising Numeric Variables

# In[9]:


sns.pairplot(housing)
plt.show()


# #### Visualising Categorical Variables.

# In[10]:


plt.figure(figsize=(20, 12))
plt.subplot(2,3,1)
sns.boxplot(x = 'mainroad', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,2)
sns.boxplot(x = 'guestroom', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,3)
sns.boxplot(x = 'basement', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,4)
sns.boxplot(x = 'hotwaterheating', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,5)
sns.boxplot(x = 'airconditioning', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.subplot(2,3,6)
sns.boxplot(x = 'furnishingstatus', y = 'price', data = housing)
plt.show()


# We can also visualise some of these categorical features parallely by using the `hue` argument. Below is the plot for `furnishingstatus` with `airconditioning` as the hue.

# In[11]:


plt.figure(figsize = (10, 5))
sns.boxplot(x = 'furnishingstatus', y = 'price', hue = 'airconditioning', data = housing)
plt.show()


# ## Step 3: Data Preparation

#  in order to fit a regression line, we would need numerical values and not string. Hence, we need to convert them to 1s and 0s, where 1 is a 'Yes' and 0 is a 'No'.

# In[12]:


# List of variables to map

varlist =  ['mainroad', 'guestroom', 'basement', 'hotwaterheating', 'airconditioning', 'prefarea']

# Defining the map function
def binary_map(x):
    return x.map({'yes': 1, "no": 0})

# Applying the function to the housing list
housing[varlist] = housing[varlist].apply(binary_map)


# In[13]:


# Check the housing dataframe now

housing.head()


# ### Dummy Variables

# The variable `furnishingstatus` has three levels. We need to convert these levels into integer as well. 
# 
# For this, we will use `dummy variables`.

# In[14]:


# Get the dummy variables for the feature 'furnishingstatus' and store it in a new variable - 'status'
status = pd.get_dummies(housing['furnishingstatus'])


# In[15]:


# Check what the dataset 'status' looks like
status.head()


# In[16]:


# Let's drop the first column from status df using 'drop_first = True'

status = pd.get_dummies(housing['furnishingstatus'], drop_first = True)


# In[17]:


# Add the results to the original housing dataframe

housing = pd.concat([housing, status], axis = 1)


# In[18]:


# Now let's see the head of our dataframe.

housing.head()


# In[19]:


# Drop 'furnishingstatus' as we have created the dummies for it

housing.drop(['furnishingstatus'], axis = 1, inplace = True)


# In[20]:


housing.head()


# ## Step 4: Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets

# In[21]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# We specify this so that the train and test data set always have the same rows, respectively
np.random.seed(0)
df_train, df_test = train_test_split(housing, train_size = 0.7, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 100)


# ### Rescaling the Features 
# 
# Min-Max scaling 

# In[22]:


from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler


# In[23]:


scaler = MinMaxScaler()


# In[24]:


# Apply scaler() to all the columns except the 'yes-no' and 'dummy' variables
num_vars = ['area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', 'parking','price']

df_train[num_vars] = scaler.fit_transform(df_train[num_vars])


# In[25]:


df_train.head()


# In[26]:


df_train.describe()


# In[27]:


# Let's check the correlation coefficients to see which variables are highly correlated

plt.figure(figsize = (16, 10))
sns.heatmap(df_train.corr(), annot = True, cmap="YlGnBu")
plt.show()


#  `area` seems to the correlated to `price` the most. Let's see a pairplot for `area` vs `price`.

# In[28]:


plt.figure(figsize=[6,6])
plt.scatter(df_train.area, df_train.price)
plt.show()


# So, we pick `area` as the first variable and we'll try to fit a regression line to that.

# ### Dividing into X and Y sets for the model building

# In[29]:


y_train = df_train.pop('price')
X_train = df_train


# ## Step 5: Building a linear model
# 
#  in `statsmodels`, we need to explicitly fit a constant using `sm.add_constant(X)` because if we don't perform this step, `statsmodels` fits a regression line passing through the origin, by default.

# In[30]:


import statsmodels.api as sm

# Add a constant
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X_train[['area']])

# Create a first fitted model
lr = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()


# In[31]:


# Check the parameters obtained

lr.params


# In[32]:


# Let's visualise the data with a scatter plot and the fitted regression line
plt.scatter(X_train_lm.iloc[:, 1], y_train)
plt.plot(X_train_lm.iloc[:, 1], 0.127 + 0.462*X_train_lm.iloc[:, 1], 'r')
plt.show()


# In[33]:


# Print a summary of the linear regression model obtained
print(lr.summary())


# ### Adding another variable
# 
# The R-squared value obtained is `0.283`. Since we have so many variables, we can clearly do better than this. So let's go ahead and add the second most highly correlated variable, i.e. `bathrooms`.

# In[34]:


# Assign all the feature variables to X
X_train_lm = X_train[['area', 'bathrooms']]


# In[35]:


# Build a linear model

import statsmodels.api as sm
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X_train_lm)

lr = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()

lr.params


# In[36]:


# Check the summary
print(lr.summary())


# We have clearly improved the model as the value of adjusted R-squared as its value has gone up to `0.477` from `0.281`.
# Let's go ahead and add another variable, `bedrooms`.

# In[37]:


# Assign all the feature variables to X
X_train_lm = X_train[['area', 'bathrooms','bedrooms']]


# In[38]:


# Build a linear model

import statsmodels.api as sm
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X_train_lm)

lr = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()

lr.params


# In[39]:


# Print the summary of the model

print(lr.summary())


# We have improved the adjusted R-squared again. Now let's go ahead and add all the feature variables.

# ### Adding all the variables to the model

# In[40]:


# Check all the columns of the dataframe

housing.columns


# In[41]:


#Build a linear model

import statsmodels.api as sm
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X_train)

lr_1 = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()

lr_1.params


# In[42]:


print(lr_1.summary())


# Looking at the p-values, it looks like some of the variables aren't really significant (in the presence of other variables).
# 
# We could simply drop the variable with the highest, non-significant p value. A better way would be to supplement this with the VIF information. 

# ### Checking VIF
# 
# Variance Inflation Factor or VIF, gives a basic quantitative idea about how much the feature variables are correlated with each other. It is an extremely important parameter to test our linear model. The formula for calculating `VIF` is:
# 
# ### $ VIF_i = \frac{1}{1 - {R_i}^2} $

# In[43]:


# Check for the VIF values of the feature variables. 
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor


# In[44]:


# Create a dataframe that will contain the names of all the feature variables and their respective VIFs
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['Features'] = X_train.columns
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X_train.values, i) for i in range(X_train.shape[1])]
vif['VIF'] = round(vif['VIF'], 2)
vif = vif.sort_values(by = "VIF", ascending = False)
vif


# We generally want a VIF that is less than 5. So there are clearly some variables we need to drop.

# ### Dropping the variable and updating the model
# 
# `semi-furnished` has a very high p-value of `0.938`. Let's go ahead and drop this variable

# In[45]:


# Dropping highly correlated variables and insignificant variables

X = X_train.drop('semi-furnished', 1,)


# In[46]:


# Build a third fitted model
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X)

lr_2 = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()


# In[47]:


# Print the summary of the model
print(lr_2.summary())


# In[48]:


# Calculate the VIFs again for the new model

vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['Features'] = X.columns
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
vif['VIF'] = round(vif['VIF'], 2)
vif = vif.sort_values(by = "VIF", ascending = False)
vif


# ### Dropping the Variable and Updating the Model

# In[49]:


# Dropping highly correlated variables and insignificant variables
X = X.drop('bedrooms', 1)


# In[50]:


# Build a second fitted model
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X)

lr_3 = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()


# In[51]:


# Print the summary of the model

print(lr_3.summary())


# In[52]:


# Calculate the VIFs again for the new model
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['Features'] = X.columns
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
vif['VIF'] = round(vif['VIF'], 2)
vif = vif.sort_values(by = "VIF", ascending = False)
vif


# ### Dropping the variable and updating the model

# In[53]:


X = X.drop('basement', 1)


# In[54]:


# Build a fourth fitted model
X_train_lm = sm.add_constant(X)

lr_4 = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_lm).fit()


# In[55]:


print(lr_4.summary())


# In[56]:


# Calculate the VIFs again for the new model
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['Features'] = X.columns
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
vif['VIF'] = round(vif['VIF'], 2)
vif = vif.sort_values(by = "VIF", ascending = False)
vif


#  the VIFs and p-values both are within an acceptable range. So we go ahead and make our predictions using this model only.

# ## Step 7: Residual Analysis of the train data
# 
# So, now to check if the error terms are also normally distributed (which is infact, one of the major assumptions of linear regression), let us plot the histogram of the error terms and see what it looks like.

# In[57]:


y_train_price = lr_4.predict(X_train_lm)


# In[58]:


# Plot the histogram of the error terms
fig = plt.figure()
sns.distplot((y_train - y_train_price), bins = 20)
fig.suptitle('Error Terms', fontsize = 20)                  # Plot heading 
plt.xlabel('Errors', fontsize = 18)                         # X-label


# ## Step 8: Making Predictions Using the Final Model
# 
# Now that we have fitted the model and checked the normality of error terms, it's time to go ahead and make predictions using the final, i.e. fourth model.

# #### Applying the scaling on the test sets

# In[59]:


num_vars = ['area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', 'parking','price']

df_test[num_vars] = scaler.transform(df_test[num_vars])


# In[60]:


df_test.describe()


# #### Dividing into X_test and y_test

# In[61]:


y_test = df_test.pop('price')
X_test = df_test


# In[62]:


# Adding constant variable to test dataframe
X_test_m4 = sm.add_constant(X_test)


# In[63]:


# Creating X_test_m4 dataframe by dropping variables from X_test_m4

X_test_m4 = X_test_m4.drop(["bedrooms", "semi-furnished", "basement"], axis = 1)


# In[64]:


# Making predictions using the fourth model

y_pred_m4 = lr_4.predict(X_test_m4)


# ## Step 9: Model Evaluation
# 
# Let's now plot the graph for actual versus predicted values.

# In[65]:


# Plotting y_test and y_pred to understand the spread

fig = plt.figure()
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred_m4)
fig.suptitle('y_test vs y_pred', fontsize = 20)              # Plot heading 
plt.xlabel('y_test', fontsize = 18)                          # X-label
plt.ylabel('y_pred', fontsize = 16)      


# 
# We can see that the equation of our best fitted line is:
# 
# $ price = 0.236  \times  area + 0.202  \times  bathrooms + 0.11 \times stories + 0.05 \times mainroad + 0.04 \times guestroom + 0.0876 \times hotwaterheating + 0.0682 \times airconditioning + 0.0629 \times parking + 0.0637 \times prefarea - 0.0337 \times unfurnished $

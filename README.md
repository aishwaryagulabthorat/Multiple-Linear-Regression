**Housing Case Study: Multiple Linear Regression**

**Problem Statement:**

This project involves a case study of a real estate company with a dataset containing property prices in the Delhi region. The goal is to optimize the sale prices of properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

**Objectives:**

- Identify Key Variables: Determine the variables affecting house prices, such as area, number of rooms, bathrooms, and more.
- Develop a Linear Model: Create a multiple linear regression model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables like the number of rooms, area, and number of bathrooms.
- Assess Model Accuracy: Evaluate the accuracy of the model to understand how well these variables can predict house prices.

**Dataset:**

The dataset includes various features related to the properties in the Delhi region, such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, parking spaces, and the corresponding prices.

**Key Components:**

Code: Scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and model building.

Data: The dataset used for the analysis.
